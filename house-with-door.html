      <p> decided this summer that I wanted to be done with metaphors. I decided that I didn’t like them because one thing is never another thing, it’s a lie to say something is anything but itself. These are old ideas of course, none of my ideas are new. But I’m trying to get at the thing directly whenever I can lately, and doing so means I have to reject a million other things, which is about staying alive.</p>
